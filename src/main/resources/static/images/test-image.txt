This is a test file to verify that the static resources directory is working correctly.

To test image loading:
1. Start your Spring Boot application
2. Access: http://localhost:8080/api/images/smartphone.jpg
3. You should see a placeholder image generated for "smartphone.jpg"

To add real images:
1. Place your image files in this directory
2. Make sure the filenames match exactly what's stored in the database
3. Restart the application if needed

Example image files needed:
- smartphone.jpg
- laptop.jpg
- headphones.jpg
- mens-tshirt.jpg
- womens-dress.jpg
- cookware-set.jpg
- coffee-maker.jpg
